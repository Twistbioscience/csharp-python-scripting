## Hardware scripting with embedded IronPython

This repository contains a simple implementation of embedded IronPython in C# for hardware control.
The sample application demonstrates how C# objects can be monitored and manipulated from a Python REPL console and a Python scripting runtime.

There is also a more sophisticated example that shows how to hook into IronPython engine's trace callback to enable live debugging and line by line execution.
